# mnist_GA
 A **mnist handwritten dataset** classifier which uses a **neural network** as its brain. The **CNN** weights act as the genes of each individual who are trained using **genetic algorithm** to produce new individuals. Similarly the training process goes on.
 
 Each individual is trained for 1 epoch and then a new generation is produced. To get better the results, keep changing the hyper parameters using hid and trial.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
cv2
numpy 
random
tensorflow==2.2
```

## Getting Started

Download a python interpreter preferable a version above 3.0. Install the prerequisite libraries given above,and make sure you have the correct version of **TensorFlow**. Also certain hardware and software requirements like good **Nvidia GPU** and **(CUDA+CUDNN)** respectively are required. Then run genetic.py in your system to train the model and save it. Then run predict.py to see the output in the format given below.

```
$ genetic.py

$ predict.py

```

## Cloning
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Shaashwat05/mnist_GA
```

## MNIST Output
The output of the classifier can be seen.
